Easy to identify with binoculars and scope, but too far for photos. ----They were seen over snow-covered, open farmland. The snow on the ground reflected a lot of light which lit up them up very well, and we immediately ruled out they were Red-tailed or Red-shouldered Hawks. ----While soaring, the wings had a low dihedral, and slow wingbeats when not soaring. The underside of the wings showed the dark carpal squares, dark wingtips, dark underwing coverts, and wide terminal band on the tail. Their face masks were also easy to see."
