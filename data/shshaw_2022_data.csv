Leggetts Creek North Scranton has a 3 level echo system. The bottom ATV trail runs along side the creek.  The second level comprised of various bush and Staghorn Suma type shrubs..  The upper top path has a lot of high grass with various trees spread sparingly throughout and several paths that interconnect.  The walk basically starts behind one baseball field and ends at another.  It's not very long, about a 15 minute walk from one end to the other.  You can spend hours cutting up and down to the different levels (as I often do).  Because of the various echo systems, the bird life is very diverse.  At the creek level you'll find Kingfishers, ducks, herons, and just about any other water fowl you can think of depending on the time of year.  Lots of woodpeckers all types.  The middle level you'll have Robins, Bluebirds, Phoebes and the like.  While the upper level is perfect for warbler type birds and many others.  Every raptor bird known loves this place.  Great little hot spot.",

Sixteen warbler species and multiple property FOYs. I hit maybe ten warbler species right outside the house and up into the upper pasture, and the good luck continued from there. I typically get good diversity and low numbers here (a trade off I would take every time) but there were several pretty good counts today. Just couldn’t get one more species to break the record, there were plenty of common enough birds left on the table.----Addendum: Ended up with 76 species for the day, which I would guess is a new high. Shame the MALL or CEWA didn’t fly over during this list.----Amphibians: American toad (heard), Gray tree frog (heard)----Butterflies: Cabbage white, Clouded sulphur ----Mammals: Coyote (The first or maybe second time that I’ve actually seen one on the property, although I hear them regularly at night through the mic. It was walking along the trail by the creek and came within 20 feet or so of me. We stared at each other for a bit before it slowly trotted off), Eastern cottontail, Eastern gray squirrel",

Walked south on Gameland Rd. from here, crossing Ridge Valley Rd., and covered a chunk of the southern area of this SGL.  A couple of hunters were setting up tree stands down here.  Some of the paths had not been mowed recently.  After wrapping up here, I walked back up to the lower parking lot, got in my car and drove to the upper parking lot at 5-10mph.  Did a loop from this lot which involved me walking south along the recently cleared gas line cut back to Gameland Rd.  3.28 miles were recorded by the app including  backtracking.--<b>Weather:</b> High 50s F rising to near 70F.

Eventually, the path turned 90 degrees to the northeast and leveled off.  I followed this path until eventually turning around at a set of red blazes.  After backtracking all the way down the hill, I walked School Rd. to Gamelands Rd., then took Gamelands out to the parking lot at 41.89237, -75.75329, which seemed like a convenient turnaround spot.  (It was along Gamelands where I hit the biggest/best mixed flock of the afternoon.  There were some nice pockets of activity at the top of the hill too.  Dead zones between all of them.  Talking 5+ minutes between birds dead zones.)  On the walk back to my car, I poked my nose into the southernmost of the food plot areas on the east side of Gamelands Rd.  (Clover planting, evidently.)  Nothing was active there, and I was feeling dehydrated, so I didn't bother exploring that area any further.  2.98 miles was recorded by the app, including backtracking.--<b>Non-bird:</b> 4 American Red Squirrels, 1 Eastern Gray Squirrel, 2 Eastern Chipmunks (heard), 3 Spring Peepers (heard).",

I initially spotted a female kestrel perched on a power line along the south side of the street, then noticed two birds perched on another power line on the north side. Turned out to be another female kestrel perched about five feet from a sharp-shinned hawk in a seemingly amicable situation. After about a half minute the SSHA took off, circled around, and buzzed the kestrel (who didn’t react)  before flying across the field where it was joined by a third kestrel, and the two did a little aerial jousting before the SSHA returned to the wire and perched only about two feet from the female kestrel it was previously near. Eventually the two of them took off together and did some half-hearted swooping and chasing before the SSHA flew into some pine trees. A fourth kestrel appeared from that vicinity shortly after; all four kestrels were observed perched around the field at the same time.",

I had a nice variety of raptors but really struck out on warblers.----Seven new birds were added to the Big Sit bringing the cumulative total up to 75.
