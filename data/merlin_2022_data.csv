I am in contact with Matthew at the American Kestrel Fund and he mentioned that I should contact Cornell as for South Central PA in February, this would be quite rare, but he also agreed that he thought it was a Merlin.

The walk basically starts behind one baseball field and ends at another.  It's not very long, about a 15 minute walk from one end to the other.  You can spend hours cutting up and down to the different levels (as I often do).  Because of the various echo systems, the bird life is very diverse.  At the creek level you'll find Kingfishers, ducks, herons, and just about any other water fowl you can think of depending on the time of year.  Lots of woodpeckers all types.  The middle level you'll have Robins, Bluebirds, Phoebes and the like.  While the upper level is perfect for warbler type birds and many others.  Every raptor bird known loves this place.

Memories of seeing one here on Jan. 4, 2019 and again on Dec. 23, 2021 loomed in my mind. And on my return trip, it was there perched on a telephone wire with its back towards me!  Only an estimated 3 million in the world and this same one, probably, is still here this winter from my December observation.  Larger than a Kestrel, smaller than a SSHA – it was about 150 ft from RT 29 – it has a very dark brown back, wings and tail – it must be a female.  Head looked roundish and its tail roundish and not long like a SSHA.  I took my eyes off the road to look to the right to see a better view of it and discovered I had driven to the left of the yellow line by more than 1 foot!  Fortunately there were not any cars coming.  I wouldn’t have looked to see the bird when I was closest to it, if there were.  Still it brought home to me that it only takes a second or two to end up where you don’t want to be.  Only for a Merlin.  Jerry Skinner said to me back in 2019 that “maybe it will stay here for the winter.”  I think this could be the fourth winter this female has used this area."

They flew several times and had very fast wingbeats. I got good looks at both of them and while the lighting was a bit tough, I saw brown striping on their undersides, yellowish tan leg feathers and dark backside. I believe I picked up a blueish hue on one backside. They both flew to and from a somewhat conical nest - did not see or hear chicks so I think they were building. A fish crow was swooping at one of the perched merlins which would cause the Merlin to fly at it."

Audio clip captured one of the Merlins calling at the beginning of the clip in the background.  At the end of the audio clip, a golf shot is heard, followed by a groan. Bad cell phone images will show profile. Was golfing, but these birds were tame and close. One was along the entrance drive later.

It's tail wasn't as long as a sharp-shinned and it had a large rounded head as opposed to the sharpie's small head.  The 3 previous times I have seen one at the Delaware Quarry - which is only about 1/4 mile from my house as birds fly, they have each had a dark back and brown stripes - the colors of a female.  The bird today had a light blue gray head, back, wings and tail and its breast was white with light streaks - a male. The picture here is a good example of what it looked like.
