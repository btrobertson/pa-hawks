Then several birds flew up out of the cornfield.  I noticed a raptor among them.  It circled several times showing a pure white underbody and black wingtips.  It finally landed in the cornfield.  I assumed it had some prey or carrion.  At first I thought it was an Osprey, but the markings weren’t quite right.  A check of Merlin and the Audubon app identified it as a Northern Harrier.  This was further confirmed by online photos from the Montana Field Guide and Bird Gallery.  I tried to get a photograph, but when it was on the ground I couldn’t see it and when it took off it flew over my truck and was gone.  It was a magnificent bird."

It flew back into the woods in front of my car and a few minutes later flew back to the field and was eating perhaps a meadow vole on the ground.  Two Ravens came over to it but did not attempt to 'steal' the vole. Harrier stayed on the ground about 5 minutes and then flew again close to their house so I had 2 delightful views of it.  Use to see a male Harrier in this same location and over my field but have not seen one here for at least the past 2 years.
